# Step 3 of Project
# 1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,  
# 2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and  
# 3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.  
# 4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.

                        #Minimum Viable Project 
                        #  
                        #   The minimum standard is a GitHub repository containing a README, a Python script, a 
                        #   generated summary text file, and images. The README (and/or notebook) should contain a 
                        #   summary of the data set and your investigations into it. It should also clearly document how 
                        #   to run the Python code and what that code does. Furthermore, it should list all references 
                        #   used in completing the project. 
 
                        #   A better project will be well organised and contain detailed explanations. The analysis will 
                        #   be well conceived, and examples of interesting analyses that others have pursued based on 
                        #   the data set will be discussed. Note that the point of this project is to use Python. You may 
                        #   use any Python libraries that you wish, whether they have been discussed in class or not. 
                        #   You should not be thinking of using spreadsheet software like Excel to do your calculations.
