## Purpose

This is an analysis of the famous Iris dataset by the British biologist Ronald Fisher. The Iris dataset is a great entry-level dataset that allows us to explore relationships between features of iris flowers and practice data analysis techniques.

It contains 150 iris flower samples from 3 different species & 4 features per sample.

**Species of iris flower:**
 - Setosa
 - Versicolor
 - Virginica

**Features of iris flower:**
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width


The module project requirements are set out below. 

1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.  
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.  
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:  
  1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,  
  2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and  
  3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.  
  4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate. 


In addition, we will create a Jupyter notebook 'Analysis.ipynb' to group our code & analysis.

## Structure of Analysis

We will explore the dataset by following the below steps in the Jupyter notebook 'Analysis.ipynb' :

1.  **Summary of the Dataset & explain the Python libraries Used**
List and brief explanation of python libraries that will be used to explore the iris dataset.

2.  **Source & Explore the Iris dataSet**
The original iris dataset can be downloaded as a csv file from the UCI website - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
We have stored a csv copy in the repository for reference - see 'Iris dataset' but we also can use the python libraries built in loader , **scikit-learn**, to import the data set directly into the Jupyter notebook - we will use the latter method.
The Iris dataset is loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` and converted into a pandas DataFrame. A comparison between the raw dataset from sklearn vs converted pandas DataFrame
Initial inspection includes checking data types, size, and a preview of the dataset using `df` and `.info()`.


3.  **Summarise the Data**
Descriptive statistics (mean,min,max,standard deviation,median) are generated using `.describe()` & saved to a text file.

4.  **Visualise Features -Histogram**
Used `matplotlib` to create histograms to understand the distribution of each feature & saved to a png file.

5.  **Investigate *& Analyse Relationships - Scatter Plot**
Used 'seaborn' to create a pairplot of the features & discuss what the pairplot depicts.
Created an additional scatter plot of two features - 'petal length (cm)' & 'petal width (cm)' - and added a regression line using 'numpy.polyfit'  to show the distribution of the data.

6.  **Other Analysis - Fit a Simple Linear Regression**
Calculated the coefficient of determination rÂ²

7.  **Analyse Class Distributions**
Create box-plots of the petal lengths for each of the three classes using color-coded plots.

8.  **Other Analysis - Compute Correlations**
Calculate the correlation coefficients between the features & display the results as a heatmap using 'matplotlib'.

9. **Conclusion**
Closing comments on the analysis & key findings.


  ## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/Mr-Scarf/pands-project.git
